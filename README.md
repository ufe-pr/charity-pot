## Introduction

### Background and Inspiration
Productivity and innovation in bringing people together have been our goals from the start. Whether through gaming, chatting, or exchanging common interests, we aim to benefit the status quo. Balancing these niches and creating utility for the crypto ecosystem inspired this project.

### Overview of the Charity Pot-Luck Game System
The **Charity Pot-Luck Game System** is an innovative platform integrating gaming, charity, and AI interactions using Baby Doge Coin. It offers an engaging game and an AI tool to assist users with queries, similar to ChatGPT.

## Project Overview

### Description of the Game
The game is played primarily with Baby Doge tokens. Users can create or join pots, bid, and increase the pot value through competitive bidding. The game has a strong charitable component, with a portion of the pot being donated to causes aligned with Baby Dogeâ€™s mission of community support and philanthropy.

### Integration of AI Tool
The project features an AI tool named Charity, which interacts with users, answering questions and providing guidance on the game and Baby Doge Coin.

## Gameplay Mechanics

### Pot Creation and Bidding Process
- **Pot Creation:** Users connect their wallets to create or join a pot.
- **Bidding:**
  - The pot is initiated with a starting bid (e.g., 100 BDG).
  - Subsequent bids must exceed the last bid (e.g., the next bid must be more than 100 BDG).
  - Each new bid extends the bidding period, allowing more users to participate.
  - The process continues until no further bids are placed, and the timer runs out.

### Reward Distribution
- **Winner:** Takes 40% of the total pot.
- **Runner-ups:** Share 40% of the pot proportionally based on their contributions.
- **Charity:** 20% is allocated to a charitable cause. The pot creator can specify the charity address, or the community DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) decides the allocation. This aligns with Baby Doge's goals of supporting charitable activities and building a strong community.

### Staking Mechanism
- The Baby Doge tokens in the pot are staked through the Baby Doge farm.
- 1% of the yield is used for maintenance.
- 99% of the yield is returned directly to the pot.

## AI Integration

### Charity: The Smart AI Chatbox
- **Introduction:**
  - Charity is an AI chatbot designed to assist users with questions about Baby Doge Coin and the Charity Pot-Luck Game System.
- **Functionality:**
  - Provides guidance on game mechanics and general queries related to Baby Doge.
